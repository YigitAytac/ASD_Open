# ASD_Open
This code opens the .asd files and corrects values to SI-traceable units. The SpecView software is used to obtain calibration values which is attached to the directory. Then the calibration values are used to obtain SI-tracerable radiance in W/m2srnm units. The integration time is set to 1 second.
